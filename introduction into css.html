<p> A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares),
which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange as well
as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies that are sold to investors through equity
crowdfunding platforms. Investments are usually made with an investment strategy in mind. </p>

Stock exchange
</div>
<p>
    A stock exchange is an exchange (or bourse) where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares (equity stock),
    bonds, and other securities. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock
    more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. These
    and other stocks may also be traded "over the counter" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have
    their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.[4]
